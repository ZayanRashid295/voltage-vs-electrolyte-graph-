This MATLAB code calculates and plots the voltage vs. electrolyte use curves for three different electrode materials (stainless steel, titanium paper, and nickel foam) in an alkaline electrolyzer. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Electrode area and thickness: The code defines the electrode areas (A_ss, A_ti, A_nf) in cm^2 and the electrode thicknesses (t_ss, t_ti, t_nf) in cm for each electrode material.

Electrolyte properties: The code specifies the concentration of KOH (KOH_conc) in wt.% and the density of KOH electrolyte (rho_KOH) in g/cm^3.

Electrode properties: The code provides the densities of the electrode materials (rho_ss, rho_ti, rho_nf) in g/cm^3.

Current density range: The code defines the minimum (j_min) and maximum (j_max) current densities in A/cm^2 and the step size (delta_j) for generating a range of current densities (j).

Voltage calculation: Using the current densities, the code calculates the voltage (V_ss, V_ti, V_nf) for each electrode material using specific equations based on the current densities. These equations use coefficients (eta_ss, eta_ti, eta_nf) specific to each electrode material.

Electrolyte use calculation: The code calculates the electrolyte use (V_ss_el, V_ti_el, V_nf_el) by dividing the voltage values by the product of the KOH density, electrode thickness, and electrode area.

Plotting: The code plots the voltage vs. electrolyte use curves for each electrode material using the plot function. The curves are represented by red (V_ss_el), blue (V_ti_el), and green (V_nf_el) lines. The plot includes axis labels, a legend, and a title.

Grid: The code adds a grid to the plot using the grid on statement.

The resulting plot shows the relationship between voltage and electrolyte use for each electrode material in an alkaline electrolyzer.
